  longDescription: "Step into a post-apocalyptic world overrun by the undead. Armed with powerful weapons and quick reflexes, fight your way through zombie-infested streets to reach the last research center. Survive intense shootouts, use power-ups, rescue hostages, and stay alive in King of the Hill or Horde modes. Shoot, run, and surviveâ€”this is humanity's last stand. As the sole Unity developer, I spearheaded the entire game lifecycle, implemented core systems, optimized performance for Android, and managed Play Store release and updates.",
